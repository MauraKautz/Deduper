## Deduper Part 1 - Pseudocode

### October 15, 2024

- Beginning Deduper assignment by writing pseudocode. Began by outlining goals from the [README.md](README.md) provided by Leslie

- Created example input and output files. Changed the SO to coordinate because these files are supposed to be sorted, not unsorted. In the test file the SO is unsorted. Input file has duplicates of certain lines and the output file removed the duplicates.
